# Some Skyrim patchers

This is a collection of patchers I created for my own Skyrim AE modlist.

## Oblivion Interaction Icon Forwarder
Forwards the "ActivateTextOverride" from [Oblivion Interaction Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52743) to the last winning override and thus keeping the change of that mod intact.

Configuration: VerboseLogging (true/false) - makes the patcher more chatty, if needed. 

You can leverage this patchers by adding them to a synthesis patch group.
